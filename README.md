# nuxt-index-request

This project aims to mirror the functionality of the repository found at https://github.com/harlan-zw/request-indexing, with the significant alteration of replacing Nuxt UI Pro with an equivalent open source or freely available Nuxt UI library. This change is to ensure that the project remains accessible without the need for proprietary software. The app's primary function is to facilitate request indexing, leveraging the capabilities of Nuxt for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SEO benefits. The chosen open source UI library will need to complement Nuxt's ecosystem, ensuring seamless integration and a consistent user experience.
